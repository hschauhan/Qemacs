# Introduction

Hoe: Himanshu's Own Emacs is a clone of Qemacs but diverges in philosophy. Qemacs does a lot of things that
an editor, IMHO, should not do. So Hoe is here only to edit code.

# Compiling
There is nothing to configure on Hoe. Just do "make".

# Licensing
QEmacs is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License so is Hoe.
(readthe accompagning COPYING file).
